    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi all! <br />
        My name is Megan and I am currently taking courses in Web Development and Visual Design! <br />
        After years of working hard in retail and constantly being promoted into Management I decided it was time for a new challenge.
        What could be more challenging than starting a whole new career in a field dominated by degrees? Lots more but this is my goal!
